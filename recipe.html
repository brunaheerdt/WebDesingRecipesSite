                  We Should All Be Making Alfredo More Often.
                </h4>
              </div>
              <p>
                My niece came to stay for an overnight a few months ago, and her
                favorite food is fettuccine alfredo, and it was at that moment
                that I said to myself – you need a good back-pocket
                Alfredo sauce recipe.
              </p>

              <p>
                I have some opinions about Alfredo sauce, and here they are:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  There should not be chunks of ANYTHING. This is a silky
                  experience.
                </li>
                <li>No flecks of minced garlic.</li>
                <li>No flecks of Italian seasoning.</li>
                <li>No cream cheese.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Another hot take: I use heavy cream in this recipe, and yes, I
                do realize that authentic Italian Alfredo sauce often does not
                always use heavy cream and this can be a divisive issue.
              </p>
              <p>
                But I grew up as a kid in the 90s thinking the fettuccine
                Alfredo from Olive Garden was one of the most beautiful foods in
                the world. I used jarred Alfredo in all kinds of questionable
                but beloved food creations in college. How could I not put cream
                in my alfredo? I want to and I have to. And when my niece asks
                for fettuccine alfredo, THIS is the kind she wants.
              </p>
              <p>
                That being said, I find that using JUST cream results in a sauce
                that is a bit much. (This is where it goes into a weirdly long
                monologue about all the things I have spent time thinking about
                related to Alfredo sauce.) I find that thinning a cream-based
                sauce with a bit of broth, plus then adding the cheese to
                thicken, gives you the perfect salty, smooth, clingy but not TOO
                sticky Alfredo sauce is just begging to wrap your favorite pasta
                in a hug.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fettuccine would be the standard pasta to use with this sauce,
                but I also LOVE a good egg pappardelle (DeLallo for life) and it
                feels about as close as you can get to homemade pasta without
                being actually homemade. The chewy layers and folds of
                pappardelle wrapped up in that silky Alfredo sauce? Ugh. So
                good.
              </p>
              <p>
                The weather is cooling down, the leaves are falling, and in our
                house, we are loving fettuccine Alfredo night right now. I’ve
                been making a pan of shrimp and broccoli along with it to make a
                full, balanced meal. A dunk of sauce here, a silky fork twirl
                there. The vibes are real good.

                  Melt the butter over low heat, and then let those smashed
                  garlic cloves infuse into the butter for a minute. Pull them
                  out after a few minutes – gives you garlic flavor while
                  preserving a silky-smooth sauce with no chunks!
